Glue Solar's Documentation
==========================

Welcome to Glue Solar's Documentation!

``Glue Solar`` is a project to provide solar physics specific functionality to
`Glue <https://glueviz.org>`__, to facilitate multi-instrument
interactive visualisation as a plugin of Glue, a Python-based project linking
visualisations across many scientific data sets. Here, we detail each part of ``Glue``
and ``Glue Solar`` and provide information for the potential adoption of ``Glue`` used with
the ``Glue Solar`` plugin by various instrument teams to build custom solutions
for their solar data.
