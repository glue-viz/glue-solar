Quick Start
-----------
We recommend going through our documentation / tutorials before starting to contribute to our repositories, namely
``glue`` and ``glue-solar``. For more information for developers, please refer to our :ref:`developers_guide`.
In case you have very specific questions regarding contributing you would like to discuss with the larger community,
you are welcome to raise your question(s) at
the `glue-solar IRC channel <https://app.element.io/#/room/#glue-solar:openastronomy.org>`_ hosted by Element.

Code of Conduct
---------------
The ``glue-solar`` community is made up of members from around the world with a diverse set of skills,
personalities, and experiences. It is through such diversity that our community experiences success
and continued growth. We expect everyone in our community to follow these guidelines when interacting
with each other both inside and outside of our community. Our goal is to keep ours a
positive, inclusive, successful, and continually growing community.

We expect our members to be:

Open
^^^^
Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether on patches, reporting issues, asking for help or otherwise.
We welcome all those who are interested in joining the community, and realise that including people
with a wide spectrum of opinions and backgrounds will only serve to enrich our community.

We are accepting of all those who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment
where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference, ensuring that all participants are heard
and feel confident that they can freely express their opinions.

Considerate
^^^^^^^^^^^
Members of the community are considerate of their peers – other developers, users, etc.
We are thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often the labor has been completed
simply for the good of the community. We are attentive in our communications, whether in person or online,
and we’re tactful when approaching differing views.

We recognize the work made by everyone and ensure the proper acknowledgement/citation of original authors at all times.
As authors, we pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or acknowledged.

Respectful
^^^^^^^^^^
Members of the community are respectful. We are respectful of the others, of their positions, skills, commitments,
and efforts. We are respectful of the volunteering and professional efforts within the community.
We are respectful of the processes as set forth in the community, and we work within them
(paying particular attention to those new to the community).

When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues. We provide a harassment- and bullying-free environment,
regardless of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality,
ethnicity, and religion. In particular, sexual language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise
exclusionary jokes are not appropriate. We will treat those outside our community
with the same respect as people within our community.

Overall, we are good to each other and apply this code of conduct to all community situations online and offline,
including mailing lists, forums, social media, conferences, meetings, associated social events,
and one-to-one interactions.

We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct, and to not remain silent
when we see violations of the code of conduct. We will take action when members of our community violate this code,
such as contacting `confidential@sunpy.org <confidential@sunpy.org>`_ (all emails sent to this address will be treated
with the strictest confidence), or talking privately with the person.

Parts of this code of conduct have been adapted from the `astropy <https://www.astropy.org/code_of_conduct.html>`_,
the `sunpy <https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/code_of_conduct.html>`_ and the
